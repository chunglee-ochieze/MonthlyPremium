# MonthlyPremium
A Blazor Server app for calculating Monthly Premium based on Age and Occupation.

It's pretty easy to get this rolling.

First off, this is a Blazor Server app built in .NET5. To enjoy it, please have your requisite runtime installed and ready from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0

Then again, if you've got no D drive on your machine, please edit the file paths in appsettings.json file, change Logger:Path and DataFile values to what suits your machine.

And you're good to go!

When the app is served up and running, click on Add to calculate and save Monthly Premium entries. You'll get a hang of how much you'll be paying as soon as you hit the submit button.

Feel free to submit as many entries as possible. And when you feel like reviewing your entries, click View to see it all in black and white.

Easy peasy, right?
