# MonthlyPremium
A Blazor Server app for calculating Monthly Premium based on Age and Occupation.

It's pretty easy to get this rolling.

First off, this is a Blazor Server app built in .NET5. To enjoy it, please have your requisite runtime installed and ready from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0

Then again, if you've got no D drive on your machine, please edit the file paths in appsettings.json file, change Logger:Path and DataFile values to what suits your machine.

And you're good to go!
